"""
11-3. Employee: 

Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should
take in a first name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these
as attributes. Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the
annual salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount.
    Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_
default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so
you donâ€™t have to create a new employee instance in each test method. Run
your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
