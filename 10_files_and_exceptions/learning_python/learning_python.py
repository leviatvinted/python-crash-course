10-1. Learning Python: 

Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few
lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line
with the phrase In Python you can.... Save the file as learning_python.txt in the
same directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads
the file and prints what you wrote three times. Print the contents once by read-
ing in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, and once by storing
the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.
