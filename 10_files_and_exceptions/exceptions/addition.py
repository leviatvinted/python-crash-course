10-6. Addition: 

One common problem when prompting for numerical input
occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts for
two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if
either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your
program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a
number.

10-7. Addition Calculator: 

Wrap your code from Exercise 10-6 in a while loop
so the user can continue entering numbers even if they make a mistake and
enter text instead of a number.
